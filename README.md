## Getting started

These instructions will get you the project up and running on your local machine for development and testing purposes. To deploy the app you will need to sign it using the signature file. For signing details go to signing section [Link it to the signing section].

## Prerequisites

You will need Android Studio, Firebase and a ‘Signature’ file to begin the development. The process won’t differ with the operating system you are using and is pretty straightforward.

## Installation

**Step 1**: Download Android Studio from this link- https://developer.android.com/studio/index.html
We have used AS “3.1 for mac”.

**Step 4**: Once you select to checkout from Github, you’ll be asked to enter use the below link and proceed. (You can even fork and use your own version of project). https://github.com/srujanb/OpenKart.git

## Firebase Integration

**Step 1**: Create a Firebase account here - https://console.firebase.google.com/u/0/

**Step 2**: Follow as shown in this video to integrate Firebase to your project https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=cNPCgJW8c-E&t=6s

You’re good to begin development.

## Signing Android Project

Android requires that all APKs be digitally signed with a certificate before they can be installed. This document describes how to sign your APKs using Android Studio, including creating and storing your certificate, signing different build configurations using different certificates, and configuring the build process to sign your APKs automatically.

Signing your project even for development is necessary as we’re using Firebase for Authentication process. Firebase-Auth depends on signature for security purpose.

## Sign your debug build

When running or debugging your project from the IDE, Android Studio automatically signs your APK with a debug certificate generated by the Android SDK tools. The first time you run or debug your project in Android Studio, the IDE automatically creates the debug keystore and certificate in $HOME/.android/debug.keystore, and sets the keystore and key passwords.

Because the debug certificate is created by the build tools and is insecure by design, most app stores (including the Google Play Store) will not accept an APK signed with a debug certificate for publishing.

Android Studio automatically stores your debug signing information in a signing configuration so you do not have to enter it every time you debug. A signing configuration is an object consisting of all of the necessary information to sign an APK, including the keystore location, keystore password, key name, and key password. You cannot directly edit the debug signing configuration, but you can configure how you [sign your release build.](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#release-mode)

For more information about how to build and run apps for debugging, see [Build and Run Your App.](https://developer.android.com/tools/building/building-studio.html)

## Sign an APK

Regardless of how you choose to manage your key and keystore, you can use Android Studio to sign your APKs (with either the upload key or the app signing key), either manually, or by configuring your build process to automatically sign APKs.

If you choose to manage and secure your own app signing key and keystore, you will sign your APKs with your app signing key. If you choose to use Google Play App Signing to manage and secure your app signing key and keystore, you will sign your APKs with your upload key.

## Generate a key and keystore

You can generate an app signing or upload key using Android Studio, using the following steps:

1.  In the menu bar, click **Build** > **Generate Signed APK.**
2.  Select a module from the drop down, and click **Next.**
3.	Click **Create new** to create a new key and keystore
4.	On the **New Key Store window**, provide the following information for your keystore and key, as shown in below figure

![100](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15925203/38444485-5a7babd4-39bd-11e8-97a0-46b6f784aa18.png)

#### Keystore
* **Key store path**: Select the location where your keystore should be created.
* **Password**: Create and confirm a secure password for your keystore.

#### Key
* **Alias**: Enter an identifying name for your key.
*	**Password**: Create and confirm a secure password for your key. This should be different from the password you chose for your keystore
*	**Validity (years)**: Set the length of time in years that your key will be valid. Your key should be valid for at least 25 years, so you can sign app updates with the same key through the lifespan of your app.
*	**Certificate**: Enter some information about yourself for your certificate. This information is not displayed in your app, but is included in your certificate as part of the APK.
Once you complete the form, click **OK**.

5.	Continue on to [Manually sign an APK](https://developer.android.com/studio/publish/app-signing.html#release-mode) if you would like to generate an APK signed with your new key, or click **Cancel** if you only want to generate a key and keystore, not sign an APK.
6.	If you would like to opt in to use Google Play App Signing, proceed to [Manage your app signing keys](https://support.google.com/googleplay/android-developer/answer/7384423) and follow the instructions to set up Google Play App Signing.




## How to use OpenKart
### 1.	Login/Signup:

Our application first checks if the user is logged in or not, then accordingly opens the app if logged in or given a login/signup screen which asks for phone number which will be used to send OTP. Here to make it simple for the user, we have kept login and signup same and user won’t have to worry about that part. Following figure shows the flow of login/signup screens:

![1](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15925203/38443173-c16cd34a-39b8-11e8-8276-8d8bb8af6e68.jpeg)       ![2](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15925203/38443241-0e762146-39b9-11e8-9011-5ce0f0889454.jpeg)       ![3](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15925203/38443283-34b41fe8-39b9-11e8-9e4f-7df757e675c4.jpeg)

### 2.	Main page to navigate between different functionalities:

After the user enters the phone number the OPT is directly detected and the user is directed to main page of the application in which he/she will be asked which functionality the user would like to use. It can be seen in the following diagram:

### 3.	Search Prospect Orders:

Now as we have just implemented the “Open Orders” functionality the user should right now only touch on that part of screen. This will open the “Open Orders” functionality in which user will be able to systematically collaborate with other users who have created prospect orders. Here the page itself acts as search page in which the search results are provided according to the radius that the user sets dynamically. By default radius is set to 1 mile and the following figure shows the screen for the same:

### 4.	Prospect Order Details:

Now if the user wants to see details of the prospect order and later join that order, he/she can click on the prospect order and will be redirected to the following page.

![7](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15925203/38443639-64913bdc-39ba-11e8-8150-a9734439cbba.jpeg)

### 5.	Collaborating with a prospect order:

If the user wishes to add items to the order and collaborate he/she can click on “Add item” button and will be redirected to following page in which they can provide the item details. Here they are asked to provide a link of the item because when the creator of prospect order is placing the order it will be helpful to him/her instead of finding the item. Also when the creator clicks on this link he/she will be redirected to that app if its already installed on the phone. Thus, this links provides a very useful functionality.

### 6.	Chat interface:

Now if the user wants to chat with other collaborators then, he/she can go to prospect orders details page and click on “chat with group” button which will open the following chat interface:

### 7.	Create Prospect Order:

If the user doesn’t find a prospect order that he/she can join then they can create their own prospect order in which other users will be able to join. It can be done as follows by clicking on the “+” sign at the right boron corner of the screen. This will further show more “+” signs with options as create prospect order and my prospect orders as shown below:

![11](https://user-images.githubusercontent.com/15925203/38443637-6485380a-39ba-11e8-9d99-1987861243de.jpeg)

When the user clicks on “add a prospect order”, he/she will be directed to a page where they can enter details about their order which will be provided when other users search for a prospect order. After giving these details the user can click on “Create prospect order” button to publish the order.
