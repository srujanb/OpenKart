# How to use OpenKart
1.	Login/Signup:

Our application first checks if the user is logged in or not, then accordingly opens the app if logged in or given a login/signup screen which asks for phone number which will be used to send OTP. Here to make it simple for the user, we have kept login and signup same and user won’t have to worry about that part. Following figure shows the flow of login/signup screens:

2.	Main page to navigate between different functionalities:

After the user enters the phone number the OPT is directly detected and the user is directed to main page of the application in which he/she will be asked which functionality the user would like to use. It can be seen in the following diagram:

3.	Search Prospect Orders:

Now as we have just implemented the “Open Orders” functionality the user should right now only touch on that part of screen. This will open the “Open Orders” functionality in which user will be able to systematically collaborate with other users who have created prospect orders. Here the page itself acts as search page in which the search results are provided according to the radius that the user sets dynamically. By default radius is set to 1 mile and the following figure shows the screen for the same:

Here the user can set their own radius and accordingly orders are shown which is depicted in the following screenshot:

4.	Prospect Order Details:

Now if the user wants to see details of the prospect order and later join that order, he/she can click on the prospect order and will be redirected to the following page.

5.	Collaborating with a prospect order:

If the user wishes to add items to the order and collaborate he/she can click on “Add item” button and will be redirected to following page in which they can provide the item details. Here they are asked to provide a link of the item because when the creator of prospect order is placing the order it will be helpful to him/her instead of finding the item. Also when the creator clicks on this link he/she will be redirected to that app if its already installed on the phone. Thus, this links provides a very useful functionality.

7.	Create Prospect Order:

If the user doesn’t find a prospect order that he/she can join then they can create their own prospect order in which other users will be able to join. It can be done as follows by clicking on the “+” sign at the right boron corner of the screen. This will further show more “+” signs with options as create prospect order and my prospect orders as shown below:

When the user clicks on “add a prospect order”, he/she will be directed to a page where they can enter details about their order which will be provided when other users search for a prospect order. After giving these details the user can click on “Create prospect order” button to publish the order.
